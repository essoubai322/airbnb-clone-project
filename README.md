## 🔐 API Security

To protect sensitive data and ensure safe operations, these security measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication (JWT/OAuth2)**: To validate user identity before allowing access to protected routes.
- **Authorization**: Role-based permissions to limit access to certain actions (e.g., only hosts can post listings).
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Prevent SQL injection, XSS, and data corruption.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of APIs (e.g., brute-force login attempts).
- **HTTPS/SSL**: All communication will be encrypted for privacy and data integrity.

> **Why this matters**: Protecting user credentials, payment info, and preventing unauthorized actions are crucial in any booking platform.

---

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment** — a development practice that automates testing, building, and deploying code.

### Tools:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate testing, linting, and deployments
- **Docker**: Containerize backend for consistent deployment
- **Netlify/Vercel**: Auto-deploy frontend from GitHub branch
- **Render/Heroku**: Deploy backend services with environment configs

> CI/CD pipelines reduce human error, allow faster iterations, and keep the codebase stable and production-ready.
